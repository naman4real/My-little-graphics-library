# My-little-graphics-library
A set of 6 assignments that I worked on for CSCI-580, 3D Graphics and Rendering at USC. These assignments combined make up for a small, basic graphics library.
HW1- Display screen setup
HW2- Rasterization of basic triangles
HW3- Transformations; including scale, rotation and translation
HW4- Flat, phong and gourad shading.
HW5- Applying textures.
HW6- Antialising.

Just clone/download the repo, open any assignement in Visual Studio (preferrably 2017) and run.
